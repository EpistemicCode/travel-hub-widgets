# travel-hub-widgets

Hand-crafted travel widgets — live hotel/flight search, local time + weather, trip countdown. Designed for Notion, but embeddable on **any lawful page you control**: your blog, docs site, product page, company intranet, newsletter, or digital template.

> ⚠️ These widgets are free to **embed** (via URL or iframe) on any lawful site. They are **not** free to copy, fork, redistribute, or rehost. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

## How to use

Paste the widget URL into an embed block. That's it — no download, no signup, no code.

**In Notion:**
```
Type /embed → paste the URL → hit Embed link → resize to the dimensions below
```

**On a website / blog / docs site:**
```html
<iframe src="https://epistemiccode.github.io/travel-hub-widgets/stays.html"
        width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"
        style="border:0; background: transparent;"></iframe>
```

Works in Ghost, WordPress, Substack (HTML/embed block), Webflow (Embed element), MDX, or any plain HTML page.

| Widget | Embed URL | Size |
|---|---|---|
| **Stays search** (hotels) | `https://epistemiccode.github.io/travel-hub-widgets/stays.html` | 480 × 360 |
| **Flights search** | `https://epistemiccode.github.io/travel-hub-widgets/flights.html` | 480 × 380 |
| **Now in …** (time + weather) | `https://epistemiccode.github.io/travel-hub-widgets/nowin.html` | 380 × 260 |
| **Trip countdown** | `https://epistemiccode.github.io/travel-hub-widgets/countdown.html` | 340 × 260 |

## Pre-configure with query params

Each widget accepts URL query parameters so you can pre-fill defaults for your trip:

```
# Stays in Bali, 1-week window, 2 adults
stays.html?city=Bali&checkin=2026-05-01&checkout=2026-05-08&adults=2

# Flight from Shanghai to Bali, round-trip
flights.html?from=SHA&to=DPS&depart=2026-05-01&return=2026-05-08&adults=2&type=RT

# Now-in Ubud, Bali (local time + live weather)
nowin.html?lat=-8.5069&lon=115.2625&tz=Asia/Makassar&place=Ubud

# Countdown to a specific trip
countdown.html?to=2026-05-02T21:40&dest=Ubud,+Bali&flight=GA+881
```

If you omit `lat`/`lon` on `nowin.html`, it auto-detects the viewer's location. If you omit the target date on `countdown.html`, it defaults to 30 days out.

## Affiliate disclosure

`stays.html` and `flights.html` link out to Trip.com. When someone clicks through and books, the widget author may earn a referral commission at no extra cost to the traveler. The outbound URLs are direct `trip.com` links — no intermediate redirect, no tracking scripts.
